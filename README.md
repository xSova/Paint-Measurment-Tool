# Wall Paint Estimator

## Description

This is a simple Java application exercise from a programming class. The application aims to estimate the amount of paint needed to cover a wall based on the wall's height and width. It considers that a gallon of paint can cover 350 square feet.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have a Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.
2. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the directory where the `Paint1.java` file is located.
4. Compile the Java file by running `javac Paint1.java` in your terminal.
5. Execute the compiled code by running `java Paint1` in your terminal.
6. Follow the on-screen prompts to enter the wall's height and width.

## Features

- **User Input:** The application prompts the user to input the wall's height and width.
- **Input Validation:** Incorporates error handling to ensure that the inputs are valid numbers greater than zero.
- **Wall Area Calculation:** Calculates the wall area based on the user inputs.
- **Paint Estimation:** Estimates the amount of paint required to cover the wall area and outputs it.

## Code Structure

- The code includes a main class `Paint1` with a `main` method that houses the application logic.
- The program flow includes input collection, input validation, and necessary calculations and output.
